    The Grow SDK is a free and open source system for modern, rapid,
    collaborative web site management and production. With Grow, everyone (from
    individual developers to large creative agencies) can save time on
    architecture and maintenance, and make time for awesome and creative front
    end web development.
  disclaimer: >-
    Thanks for checking out Grow! We're still *experimental* and in heavy
    development, including the documentation. We may make backwards incompatible
    changes, so try it out at your own risk.

      Control your site's URLs, localization rules, content hierarchy, structure
      and behavior all with configuration, not with code. You won't have to
      program your site's serving logic again and again, so your site-building
      process stays rapid and nimble. Modifications to to your architecture are
      always just a config change away.

      Localization comes included so you can reach a global audience. You can
      configure localized URL formats, easily specify what content is translated
      and what isn't, localize your content and its fields, and integrate with
      translation providers to translate your projects.
  - title: 'Develop everywhere, deploy anywhere.'
    image: /static/images/deploy.svg
    content: >-
      Grow web sites are entirely file-based and are backed by Git, with no
      databases for you to maintain. Development can happen on your local
      machine or in the cloud. Grow can build and deploy to a variety of
      destinations - or it can export static files for you to integrate with
      your custom web server.
  - title: No installation or maintenance.

      You can focus on what matters - your web sites - when you use the Grow
      SDK. Your projects are stored and managed entirely separate from the SDK,
      so you'll never have to maintain a deployed installation or deal with
      upgrades. Grow tests and verifies your sites every time you deploy them,
      and warns you when it discovers issues in your code related to web
      security.
