# The Grow SDK Project

The Grow SDK is an open source project developed by [The Grow SDK Authors](https://github.com/grow/pygrow/blob/master/AUTHORS) and it's released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/grow/pygrow/blob/master/LICENSE).

### Grow's mission is to bring joy to building and launching web sites

Grow aims to be the canonical way for teams and individuals to build and launch high-quality, content-rich web sites. It's architected to work for humans, allow people to use their own development tools, run locally and in the cloud, and to bring simplicity to web site management.

The Grow SDK (the software) and the stuff you make with it (your pods) are portable. You can run Grow anywhere, and you can take your content anywhere because content is stored as flat files. There will never be lock-in with Grow.

### The technology

The current reference implementation of the Grow SDK is written in Python and projects are file-based and backed by Git. The current version of the Grow SDK is a static site generator - meaning you can use it to build and deploy sites almost anywhere.

### The roadmap

Grow's development is just getting started. For the initial release, we are focused on building a perfomant static site generator that can run both locally and in the cloud -- and deploy anywhere. Subsequent versions will focus on Git integration, project management, and collaboration.
